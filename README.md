# Fan controller

This window fan sucks.  It has a single button which cycles through low, high, and a series of temperature values which I guess are some kind of themostat.  The fan can't do any speeds other than high or low, but it does have a selector below each fan to set "Intake" or "Exhaust".  It's basically always in the wrong mode and sometimes the button sticks and it switches modes randomly.  Holding the button down for a few seconds turns off the fan.

This project seeks to improve the user interface for the fan, giving it more controllability.

Rules: no money can be spent on the POC. Strict $20 limit on the final version.

## Improvements

Per fan:
1. a switch for turning it on/off
2. a switch for fan direction
3. a potentiometer for controlling the speed
Stretch Goal: LEDs to indicate on state of each fan
